# fu3e Developer Test

### Introduction
This is a small test based around a simple application where a user can interact with a frontend Vue based table to generate CSV data. You can add rows & columns and then export the table into a CSV file using a Laravel API end-point. The application is incomplete and you'll need to complete the following tasks and fix any bugs we have introduced.

- Add the ability to add a new column to the table
- Add the ability to add a new row to the table
- Add the ability to remove a row from the table
- Add the PHP logic in the `CsvExport` class to convert the user input into a CSV

In addition to the above tasks being complete, we will be looking out for
- The use of test suites
- Good user experience
- Meeting common coding standards in the PHP & VueJs code

### Setup

- `npm install && npm run watch`
- `php artisan serve --port=8085`
- Visit http://localhost:8085
